🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
This project is a showcase of modern Flutter development practices and a robust, scalable architecture.
Core Technologies
Framework: Flutter
Language: Dart
State Management: flutter_bloc / bloc
Navigation: auto_route for type-safe, generated routing.
Dependency Injection: get_it for service location.
Networking: dio for powerful and reliable HTTP requests.
Local Storage: shared_preferences for persisting theme and favorite choices.
Code Generation: build_runner, json_serializable.
Architecture
The application is built following the principles of Clean Architecture. This separates the code into three distinct layers, ensuring that the business logic is independent of the UI and data sources.
Domain Layer: The core of the application. It contains the business logic (Use Cases) and entity definitions. It has no dependencies on any other layer.
Data Layer: Responsible for all data operations. It implements the repository contracts defined in the Domain layer and handles communication with the API and local storage.
Presentation Layer: The UI of the application. It contains all the screens, widgets, and BLoCs responsible for managing the UI state and reacting to user input.

📁 Project Structure
The project follows a feature-first structure, where code is organized by application features.
